## Welcome to your Web Development Tutor!

The Web Dev Tutor was built was built in html and css to help teach you the basics of web development.

This was my second project using a relational database (my first was the Secret Santa Organizer), but I was still pretty confused about how everything fit together. I used phpMyAdmin and created this website to walk through, step by step, how to connect to a MySQL database and make GET and POST requests to query data.

### How It Works
Read through and follow the modules to create and connect to the database!
By the end of the modules, you'll be able to submit a form, similar to the "contact us" form on the homepage, and have the submitted data saved to a database!
### Lessons Learned
I learned how to use HTTP methods to fetch and send data.
I learned how to structure tables and insert data into a MySQL database.
